Calculating Carbon Sequestration in Forests

1. Tree Measurements
   - Measure Diameter at Breast Height (DBH) and tree height to estimate biomass.

2. Allometric Equations
   - Use species-specific equations to convert DBH and height into above-ground biomass.

3. Biomass to Carbon Conversion
   - Assume approximately 50% of biomass is carbon to calculate stored carbon.

4. Soil Carbon Analysis
   - Collect soil samples to measure carbon stored in forest soils.

5. Remote Sensing
   - Use satellite imagery and LiDAR to estimate biomass across large areas.

6. Growth Rate Monitoring
   - Track tree growth over time to determine annual carbon sequestration rates.

7. Carbon Stock Change Method
   - Compare carbon stock (biomass + soil carbon) between two points in time.

8. Modeling Tools
   - Use forest growth and carbon cycle models to estimate sequestration under different scenarios.

9. Long-term Monitoring
   - Establish permanent plots for consistent measurement and monitoring of carbon sequestration trends.

10. Integration with GIS
    - Combine field data and spatial analysis to map carbon storage and sequestration potential across forest landscapes.
